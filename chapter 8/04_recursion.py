    -> Recursion is a function which calls itself.

    -> It is used to directly use a mathematical formula as function.


    ------------EXAMPLE-------------

    factorial(0) = 1 
    factorial(1) = 1 
    factorial(2) = 2 X 1 
    factorial(3) = 3 X 2 X 1  
    factorial(4) = 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 
    factorial(5) = 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 
    factorial(n) = n X ( n-1 ) X ............ X 3 X 2 X 1 

    factorial(n) = n * factorial( n-1 )
